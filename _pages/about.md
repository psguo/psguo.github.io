I am currently working at Apple as a machine learning engineer and researcher. I worked with cross-functional teams to deliver AR/VR features with Apple quality while conducting research in multiple fields and publishing in ICML, CVPR & WACV. I graduated from the M.S. program of the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, supervised by Prof. David Held. I received my Bachelor degree from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, with a focus in robotics.

My research interests include robotics, computer graphics, computer vision, and machine learning.
